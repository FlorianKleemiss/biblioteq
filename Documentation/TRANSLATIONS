Please verify that translations are consistent. BiblioteQ uses table
column headers in order to locate columns. If a translation
is not consistent, correct columns may not be located.

The Translations directory must reside in the directory where the BiblioteQ
executable resides.

Creating Translation Files

Translation files consist of all the user-visible text and Ctrl
key accelerators in an application and translations of that text.

To create translation files:

    Run lupdate to generate the first set of translation source (TS) files
    with all the user-visible text but no translations.

    Give the TS files to the translator who adds translations using
    Qt Linguist. Qt Linguist takes care of any changed or deleted source text.

    Run lupdate to incorporate any new text added to the application.
    lupdate synchronizes the user-visible text from the application with
    the translations. It does not destroy any data.

    To release the application, run lrelease to read the TS files and
    produce the QM files used by the application at runtime.

For lupdate to work successfully, it must know which translation files
to produce. The files are listed in the application's .pro Qt project file.

> lupdate biblioteq.pro
> lrelease biblioteq.pro
