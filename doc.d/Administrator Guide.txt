BiblioteQ Administrator Guide

Introduction

	This document details the process for installing, configuring, and uninstalling BiblioteQ.

1. Database Configuration

	1.1 PostgreSQL Database Configuration

	BiblioteQ supports versions 8.x  and 9.x of PostgreSQL. Please follow the PostgreSQL-provided documentation for installing PostgreSQL. After installing the required PostgreSQL packages, please perform the following operations:
a) Create the xbook_db database via createdb xbook_db -E UTF8 or via the PostgreSQL-recommended protocol. Please note that xbook_db is only a suggestion.
b) Execute createlang plpgsql -d xbook_db or the PostgreSQL-recommended protocol for adding a new programming language to the database.
c) Replace all instances of the default administrator xbook_admin in postgresql_create_schema.sql file.
d) Log into your PostgreSQL database and load the postgresql_create_schema.sql file via \i postgresql_create_schema.sql.

	1.2 Database Updates

	It is sometimes necessary to update a database schema after a software update. To do so, please execute the SQL statements that are located in the postgresql_update_schema.sql. You may also be required to execute additional steps via BiblioteQ. Please read and follow the version-specific instructions listed at http://biblioteq.sourceforge.net/release_notes.html.

2. BiblioteQ Installation

	2.1 OS X Installation

	Please copy the contents of the OS X bundle to the desired folder.

	2.2 Unix Installation

	Installing BiblioteQ on platforms that lack installers involves several operations. First, please 	resolve the following software prerequisites:
a) Qt 4.8.4 must be installed. Qt 5.x is not yet supported. Please download the software from http://qt-project.org/downloads. You have the option of building Qt with the PostgreSQL driver or creating the driver separately as a plugin. You may compile Qt with the PostgreSQL driver via ./configure -v -qt-sql-psql -I /usr/local/include/postgresql -L /usr/local/lib/postgresql. The include and library directories may be different depending upon your environment.
b) YAZ 4.2.x, or higher, must be installed. Please download the software from http://www.indexdata.com/yaz.
c) If you intend to use PostgreSQL, the PostgreSQL database package must be installed. Please download the software from http://www.postgresql.org/download.
d) If you intend to use SQLite, the SQLite 3.5.6 package must be installed. Please download the software from http://www.sqlite.org/download.html.
e) After the required dependencies have been fulfilled and your environment is properly configured for Qt, build BiblioteQ via qmake -o Makefile biblioteq.pro && make.
f) Finally, execute sudo make install.

	2.3 Windows Installation

	Windows users are urged to download the appropriate installer. After an installer has been 	downloaded, double-click on the appropriate icon and follow the on-screen instructions.

3. Configuring BiblioteQ

	Configuring the runtime environment of BiblioteQ is relatively easy. Bundled with the software is the biblioteq.conf file. After BiblioteQ has been installed, please review the biblioteq.conf file. If necessary, please modify it to suit your preferences.

4. Uninstalling BiblioteQ

	4.1 OS X

	To uninstall BiblioteQ, simply remove the /Applications/BiblioteQ.d directory. You may also wish to remove users' configuration files (/Users/user/Library/Preferences/net.sourceforge.biblioteq.BiblioteQ.plist).

	4.2 Unix

	To uninstall BiblioteQ, remove the /usr/local/biblioteq directory and the /usr/local/bin/biblioteq.sh script. You may also wish to remove users' configuration directories (/home/user/.config/BiblioteQ).

	4.3 Windows

	Simply run the BiblioteQ-Uninstaller executable that is located in your installation directory. You may also wish to remove the registry entry for BiblioteQ. Launch regedit and remove My Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\BiblioteQ.

5. PostgreSQL Database Removal

	The script postgresql_destroy_schema.sql may be used to remove the original database xbook_db and other objects created by the postgresql_create_schema.sql script.

	5.1 OS X and Unix

	The dropdb command may be used to remove a PostgreSQL database. The dropuser command may be used to remove PostgreSQL users. If available, pgAdmin may also be used.

	5.2 Windows

	Please use pgAdmin.

6. SQLite Database Removal

	Delete the desired SQLite database file(s).
